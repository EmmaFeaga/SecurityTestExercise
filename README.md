# SecurityTestExercise    

Build a basic SIEM using docker compose and the following products:
- Elastic stack (Self managed – Free and Open Basic License)
- Nginx web proxy
- Any test web application you would like

The goal here is to implement a basic SIEM based on Elastic’s SIEM functionality, ingesting logs from a web application and being correlated in the SIEM.

Outcomes
1.) Should be able to use docker compose to stand up your project with no manual steps.
2.) Should be able to use whatever web application you have chosen.
3.) All logs/audit activity/activity should end up in the SIEM.
