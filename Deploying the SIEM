Before beginning these steps, make sure that you have all of the tools and products you need installed on your VM. You should have:
      1. Docker Compose 
      2. Elastick stack (I recommend downloading the elastdocker template to simplify things - git clone https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/elastdocker.git)
      3. Nginx

NOTE: If you are not set as root, you will need to execute your commands with 'sudo' in front.

Note: By default, Elastic Stack exposes the following ports:
5000: Logstash TCP input.
9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
5601: Kibana


Step 1: Start up the Elastic Stack using Docker Compose:
      sudo docker-compose up

You can also choose to run it in background (detached mode):
      sudo docker-compose up -d
      
Step 2: Go to your web browser of choice and navigate to kibana
      http://localhost:5601 

Step 3: Now you will want to generate a container. In this case, we are using the name Ngnix:
      sudo docker run nginx
   
Step 4: Go back to your web browser to view the incoming data/logs

Step 5: I think you can also use logstash to generate logs as well but I have not gotten that far.
