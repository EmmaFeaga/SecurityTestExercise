Docker Compose Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 
In other words, it is used to auto setup docker containers and configurations.

You will need to install Docker Engine. To do so, copy and paste the following in your command line: 
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

Test to make sure that it installed correctly, copy and paste the following in your command line:
        sudo docker run hello-world
        
To run the Docker, copy and paste the following in your command line:
        sudo docker compose up 
        
To view other useful Docker commands, use the --help tag:
        sudo docker compose --help
